                <h1><i>&#128142;What is the Priority of a Web Developer?&#128142;</i></h1>

                <p>To answer the question “What is a web developer?”, we must first look at what
                    a web developer does and how they do it.

                    A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design
                    - which has been created by either a client or a design
                    team - and turns it into a website.

                    They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code,
                    using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job,
                    because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English,
                    and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.</p>

                <p>Web Developer responsibilities include:
                    Writing well designed, testable, efficient code by using best software development practices
                    Creating website layout/user interfaces by using standard HTML/CSS practices
                    Integrating data from various back-end services and databases</p>
                <p>&#128166;What Types Of Web Developers Are There?
                    Unfortunately, the question “What does a web developer do?”
                    doesn’t have one simple answer. As noted above,
                    there are some different types of web developers,
                    each of which focuses on a different aspect of the creation of a website.

                    To understand what is a web developer it is crucial to know that
                    the three main types of developers are&#128152; front-end,&#128152; back-end,&#128152; and
                    full-stack&#128152;.

                    Front-end developers are responsible for the parts of a website that people see and interact with,
                    back-end developers are responsible for the behind the scenes code that controls how a website loads
                    and runs, and full-stack developers do a bit of everything.

                    Front-End Developer
                    A front-end developer is someone who takes a client or design team’s website design and writes the
                    code needed to implement it on the web. A decent front-end web developer will be fluent in at least
                    three programming languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    What is a web developer: HTML code

                    HTML allows them to add content to a website while splitting it into headings,
                    paragraphs, and tables. CSS lets a decent developer style the content and change
                    things like colors, sizes, and borders. JavaScript allows the inclusion of interactive
                    elements, such as push buttons. We will go into more detail about these languages
                    later.

                    So, what do web developers do when they work on the front end of a website?

                    What is a web developer responsible for is that they make sure that all of the content that is
                    needed for the website is clear, visible, and found in the right place. In some cases front-end
                    developers may also have content writing skills, allowing them to create the content for the
                    website as they go.
                    They make sure that the right colors are in the right places, especially concerning text colors,
                    background colors, and headers. Some of the best front-end developers are also very good designers,
                    allowing them to tweak things as they go.
                    They make sure that all outbound links are correctly formatted, that all buttons work properly,
                    and that the website is responsive and attractive. Mobile design is usually a big part of the job,
                    while it is also important to make sure that a website will display correctly on all web browsers.
                    As you can see, the answer to the question “What is a web developer?” certainly isn’t simple. Even
                    front-end developers have it tough, and this is probably the simplest of the three types of
                    development
                    to learn.</p>
